# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.1.9] - 2026-03-01
### Added
- **Enhanced Narrative Spotlight**:
  - Cinematic sequenced activation (zoom first, then card).
  - High-resolution actor portraits used instead of tokens.
  - Subtitle displaying both Role and Faction information.
  - Centered overlay design with optimized camera centering to keep the character visible.
  - Improved aesthetics: Golden divider, red-themed title text.
  - Manual close only (auto-hide removed for better storytelling pacing).
- **Spectator Camera Sync**: Real-time GM camera broadcasting to all connected players and the monitor.
- **UI & Controls**: New "Spectator Mode" toggle in the View tab and "Spotlight" context menu action.
- **Localization**: Full German and English support for all Storyteller features.

## [1.1.8] - 2026-03-01
### Added
- **Auto-Zoom to Fit**: The graph now automatically adjusts zoom on open to ensure all tokens are visible within the canvas.
- **Monitor-Exclusive Boss Pivot**: For the dedicated Monitor account (user name containing "monitor"), the view now centers strictly on "Center" (Boss) nodes.
- **Center Graph Button**: Added a manual button in the "View" tab to re-center and fit the graph to the current view.
- **Localization**: Added EN/DE strings for the new centering features.

### Fixed
- **Persistent Auto-Zoom**: Auto-zoom now triggers reliably every time the graph is closed and re-opened.
- **Constructor Stability**: Resolved a critical race condition where D3 was accessed before loading.
- **Manual Zoom Preservation**: Changing sidebar settings no longer resets your manually adjusted zoom level to 100%.
- **V13 Application Lifecycle**: Corrected `_onClose` and `render` calls for full Foundry V13 `ApplicationV2` compatibility.
- **Zero-Padding Monitor View**: Screen centering on the monitor is now mathematically perfect by removing viewport offsets.

## [1.1.5] - 2026-02-28
### Added
- **Context-Sensitive Sidebar**: The sidebar now adapts to your selection (Node vs Link).
- **Interactive Selection**: Clicking a token or link in the graph immediately selects it in the sidebar.
- **Singleton Guard**: Prevented multiple FANG windows from opening simultaneously.

## [1.1.4] - 2026-02-27
### Added
- **Visual Grouping (Factions)**: Group characters into factions with custom icons, colors, and visual hubs.
- **Sidebar Tab Redesign**: Reorganized the sidebar into Editor, View, and Advanced tabs.

## [1.1.3] - 2026-02-26
### Added
- **Context Menu**: Right-click tokens for quick access to role, lore, and deletion.
- **Hover Lore**: Hover over tokens to see their background story in a premium tooltip.

## [1.1.2] - 2026-02-25
### Added
- **Boss Nodes (Center Gravity)**: Mark important characters as "Centers" to have them gravitate to the middle with a golden aura.
