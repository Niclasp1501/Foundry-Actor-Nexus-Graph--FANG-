# Foundry Actor Nexus Graph (FANG)

An interactive, force-simulation graph for Actors in Foundry VTT V13. FANG enables Game Masters and players to visualize relationships, networks, and connections between different actors (characters, NPCs, organizations) inside the game world in an intuitive and visually appealing way.

## Features
- **Interactive Force-Simulation:** View actors and their relationships as nodes and links in a dynamic graph.
- **Node & Link Management:** GMs can effortlessly add tokens, create links (both straight and curved Bezier lines), and remove tokens or links as the story progresses.
- **Player Sharing:** GMs can push the current graph view to all connected players, ensuring everyone is on the same page.
- **GM Controls:** Includes a dedicated "Close for Players" button, giving the GM full control over when the graph is visible to the party.
- **Full Module Compatibility:** Tested and fully compatible with Monk's Common Display to ensure the graph window is always visible when you need it.
